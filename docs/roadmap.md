## MCP Integration Strategy

### Core MCP Servers (Phase 1)
1. **Pinterest MCP** - Essential for design inspiration workflows
   - Search Pinterest for design inspiration
   - Create mood boards and collect visual references
   - Integrate inspiration directly into project workflows

2. **SketchUp MCP** - 3D modeling and space planning capabilities
   - AI-assisted 3D modeling and scene creation
   - Direct manipulation of SketchUp models through natural language
   - Space planning and architectural visualization

### Implementation Approach
- **Focused rollout** - Start with Pinterest and SketchUp only
- **Configuration management** - Simple MCP server configuration in Claude Desktop
- **User documentation** - Clear setup guides for both MCP servers
- **Error handling** - Graceful fallbacks when MCP servers are unavailable

### Technical Considerations
- **Security** - Secure API key management for Pinterest API
- **Performance** - Efficient communication with SketchUp via TCP socket
- **User Experience** - Seamless integration without exposing technical complexity
- **Documentation** - Clear setup instructions following Cursor MCP guidelines
