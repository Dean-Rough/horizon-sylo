## ðŸ”„ Data Flow & Relationships

### Client â†’ Project â†’ Task Hierarchy
1. **Clients** can have multiple **Projects**
2. **Projects** belong to one **Client** and can have multiple **Tasks**
3. **Tasks** belong to one **Project** (and indirectly to a **Client**)

### Real-time Integration
- All components fetch real-time data from Supabase
- CRUD operations immediately update the UI
- Proper error handling with fallback to mock data
- Loading states for better UX

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Features

### Design System
- Consistent use of Sylo brand colors and typography
- Circular font family for body text
- Druk font for display elements
- Proper spacing and layout patterns

### Interactive Elements
- Modal dialogs for forms and details
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Sortable data tables/grids
- Action buttons with hover states
- Badge components for status/type indicators

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Flexible grid layouts
- Collapsible navigation
- Touch-friendly interactions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Type Safety
- Full TypeScript integration
- Database types from `types/database.ts`
- Proper interface definitions for all data structures
- Type-safe API calls and responses

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks in all async operations
- Graceful fallbacks to mock data
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging

### Performance

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Instructions

### Creating a New Client
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/clients`
2. Click "New Client" button
3. Fill out the client form with required information
4. Save to create the client record

### Creating a New Project
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/projects`
2. Click "New Project" button
3. Select a client from the dropdown
4. Fill out project details including budget and timeline
5. Save to create the project record

### Creating a New Task
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/tasks`
2. Select a project from the dropdown (or "All Projects")
3. Click "New Task" button
4. Fill out task details and assign to project
5. Save to create the task record

### Managing Relationships
- Projects automatically link to selected clients
- Tasks automatically link to selected projects
- Client detail view shows all associated projects
- Project detail view shows all associated tasks
- Kanban board filters tasks by selected project

This completes the Phase 2 implementation with a fully functional project management system integrated into the existing dashboard structure.
