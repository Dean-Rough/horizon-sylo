# Sylo Database Migration Status

## Overview
This document tracks the status of Phase 2 and Phase 3 database migrations for the Sylo project management platform.

## Migration Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed
- **Phase 2 Tables Created**: All project management tables are successfully created
  - `clients` - Client information and contact details
  - `projects` - Project management with status, timeline, and budget tracking
  - `tasks` - Task management with Kanban board support and hierarchical structure

- **Phase 3 Tables Created**: All material library tables are successfully created
  - `suppliers` - Supplier and vendor management
  - `materials` - Comprehensive material catalog with specifications
  - `material_collections` - Curated collections and mood boards
  - `collection_materials` - Junction table for collection-material relationships
  - `project_assets` - File and asset management with approval workflow
  - `material_samples` - Sample request and tracking system

- **TypeScript Types Updated**: All type definitions are current and comprehensive
  - Core database types in `types/database.ts`
  - Additional utility types and filters in `types/types.ts`
  - Form data types for creating/updating records
  - API response types for frontend integration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Completed
- **Database Indexes**: Tables exist but performance indexes may be missing
- **RLS Policies**: Row Level Security policies may not be fully implemented
- **Trigger Functions**: Automated timestamp and status triggers may be missing

### üîß Manual Steps Required

#### 1. Complete Database Migration
The core tables were created successfully, but indexes, RLS policies, and triggers need to be applied manually:

1. **Sign in to Supabase Dashboard**
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jnkfafylcsfnxcueecyx/sql

2. **Run Complete Migration SQL**
   - File: `supabase/combined-migrations.sql` (already generated)
   - This file contains both Phase 2 and Phase 3 migrations with all indexes, RLS policies, and triggers

3. **Verify Migration Success**
   - Run the verification script: `node scripts/verify-migration-status.js`
   - Check that all tables, indexes, and policies are in place

#### 2. Test Database Functionality
After completing the manual migration:

1. **Test Table Access**
   ```bash
   node scripts/verify-migration-status.js
   ```

2. **Test RLS Policies**
   - Create test records through the application
   - Verify users can only access their own data
   - Test team member access to shared projects

3. **Test Triggers**
   - Update records and verify `updated_at` timestamps are automatically set
   - Complete tasks and verify `completed_at` is set automatically

## Database Schema Overview

### Phase 2: Project Management
```
clients (9 fields) ‚Üí projects (21 fields) ‚Üí tasks (18 fields)
                                        ‚Üó subtasks (self-referencing)
```

### Phase 3: Material Library
```
suppliers (25 fields) ‚Üí materials (42 fields) ‚Üí material_samples (16 fields)
                                            ‚Üó collection_materials ‚Üí material_collections (12 fields)
                                            ‚Üó project_assets (23 fields)
```

## Key Features Enabled

### Project Management (Phase 2)
- ‚úÖ Client relationship management
- ‚úÖ Project lifecycle tracking
- ‚úÖ Team collaboration and assignment
- ‚úÖ Task management with Kanban boards
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical task structure (subtasks)
- ‚úÖ Timeline and budget tracking

### Material Library (Phase 3)
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive material catalog
- ‚úÖ Supplier and vendor management
- ‚úÖ Material collections and mood boards
- ‚úÖ Sample request and tracking
- ‚úÖ Project asset management
- ‚úÖ File approval workflows
- ‚úÖ Advanced search and filtering

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Clients**: Users can only access clients they created
- **Projects**: Access for creators, assignees, and team members
- **Tasks**: Access based on project permissions
- **Materials/Suppliers**: Public read access, creator can modify
- **Collections**: Private by default, can be shared or made public
- **Assets**: Access based on project permissions

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
- Check constraints ensure valid enum values
- Soft delete pattern preserves data history
- Automatic timestamp management

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Manual Migration** (Priority: High)
   - Run the combined migration SQL in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Verify all indexes and policies are created

2. **Frontend Integration** (Priority: Medium)
   - Update API endpoints to use new tables
   - Implement CRUD operations for all entities
   - Add search and filtering functionality

3. **Testing** (Priority: High)
   - Unit tests for database operations
   - Integration tests for RLS policies
   - Performance testing with indexes

4. **Documentation** (Priority: Low)
   - API documentation for new endpoints
   - User guide for new features
   - Developer documentation for database schema
